# RedSolve issue reporting

We work hard to make the Redback Systems RedSolve software an excellent tool for your spectroscopy and analysis, but sometimes things don't quite work as expected. This is the place to log bugs and feature requests.

Head over to the [Issues](/../../issues) tab and let us know what needs to be done!
